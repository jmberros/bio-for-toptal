## Coronavirus mutations in Buenos Aires strains
{: #sarscov2 }

The laboratory where I worked was part of [Proyecto-PAIS](http://pais.qb.fcen.uba.ar/), a country-wide effort in Argentina to sequence and analyse SARS-Cov-2 DNA samples.

All plots were done with Python's `matplotlib`.

### Types of mutations per lineage/cluster

Individual mutations in the first X axis with aminoacid change and position nomenclature. Lineages and clusters within lineages in the Y axis. Marginal histograms are also shown to summarize types of mutations and number of samples corresponding to each SARS-Cov-2 lineage/cluster.

### Number of samples representing each mutation/lineage

The number of samples is displayed for each individual combination of lineage and mutation type, while the marginal histograms display total samples per mutation (top) or per virus lineage (right).
