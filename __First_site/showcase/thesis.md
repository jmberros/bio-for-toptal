The thesis I developed had two main parts:

- Analysis and testing of embryo scores of aneuploidy.
- Analysis of negatively correlated polygenic risk scores of disease.

These are some of the charts made for both of those chapters, with a brief explanation. The captions and plot labels are in Spanish because the thesis was presented in the University of Buenos Aires.
